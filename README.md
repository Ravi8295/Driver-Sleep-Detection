# Driver-Sleep-Detection
In current years, drowsy driver detection is the most necessary procedure to prevent any road accidents, probably worldwide. The aim of this model was to construct a smart alert technique for building intelligent vehicles that can automatically avoid drowsy driver impairment. But drowsiness is a natural phenomenon in the human body that happens due to different factors. Hence, it is required to design a robust alert system to avoid the cause of the mishap. In this proposed model, a drowsy driver alert system that has been developed using such a technique in which the Video Stream Processing (VSP) is analysed by eye blink concept through an Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Euclidean distance of the eye. When the driverâ€™s fatigue is detected, the IoT module issues a warning message along with impact of collision, thereby alerting with the help of a alarm/buzzer sound through the Aurdino UNO monitoring system.
